(ns opticsworks.export
  "Audit-package export for social / regulatory hand-off.

  Produces plain EDN maps and CSV strings over an `opticsworks.store/
  Store` snapshot -- the same append-only ledger, optical-module-batch-
  shipment drafts and Optical-Module-Test-Certificate drafts the
  governor writes. Pure data transforms only: no I/O, no network, no
  signature. The camera/optical-module manufacturer's own act is to
  sign and file the package; this namespace only materializes the
  package body.

  This is the honest delivery of the industry-stack `:export?` contract
  (robotics / audit-ledger capabilities) for ISIC 2670."
